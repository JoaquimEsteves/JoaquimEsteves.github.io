  <p>I've only ever had two jobs really.</p>
  <p>

    worked under a variety of teams. It's the only good part of being a

    <h3>ProSieben</h3>
    <h4>Through CBTW: from 12/2022 to 04/2024</h4>
    <p>Context:</p>

    <p>ProSieben's Program Planners have a problem.</p>
    <p>
      The way movie licensing works is: A company buys the rights to play a
      movie or show ùëµ times over a period of ùêò years. As a program planner your
      job is to optimize this, play a movie less than ùëµ times and you've just
      lost money, play it at the wrong time and you've just lost market share!
      (ie: money)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, program planners are quite good at their jobs, but doing this sort of
      planning on a large scale is tremendously difficult work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution, was to ask the Data Science folks to come up with a model
      that will first predict market shares(or, the fancier sounding: AI Based
      Prediction), and then to build a second model that will attempt to create
      an optimal program (using an even fancier sounding: Constraint
      Satisfaction Solver)
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of these models necessitated a large amount of data.
      Corralling, cleaning and exporting this data was the job of our
      <em>ETL</em> pipeline.
    </p>

    <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
    <p>
      I was initially hired as Python Developer; mostly to work on the App side
      of the project
    </p>

    <code>
      <pre style="line-height: 21px">
      UI ‚Üê App ‚Üê AI ‚Üê DB ‚Üê ETL
           ‚îî‚îÄ I worked       ‚îÇ
              here!          ‚îî and here!
    </pre
      >
    </code>

    <p>
      Once I had proven myself on the <code>App</code> side of the project I was
      able to transition into the <code>ETL</code> side of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time I had the pleasure to work as a Data-Engineer. I'd
      always wanted to dip my feet into the Data Science world but I never had
      the opportunity before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learned a lot of Pandas, a scientific python library; and I was able to
      leverage my Front-End skills to create what we called "tiny-front-ends".
      Basically small Websites as GUIs to quickly prototype features, while the
      main Front-End team lagged behind.

    <h3>KPMG Luxembourg</h3>
    <h4>Through CBTW : from 05/2022 to 08/2022</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>Context:</p>

    <p>KPMG's HR have a problem.</p>
    <p>
      Every year they need to calculate raises and bonuses for each of the
      employees. Back when the branch was a few hundred employees this was all
      done on a massive excel spreadsheet; but suddenly the Luxembourgish branch
      grew to a gargantuan 2000 employees and clearly some sort of app needed to
      be made.
    </p>
    <p>They then made a grave mistake - they hired consultants.</p>
    <p>
      The consultants delivered a terrible mess. A C# back-end full of business
      rules that contradict each other sprayed to-and-fro. A "classic" jQuery +
      Bootstrap Front-End with yet more business rules that contradict the
      former ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody internal to the company wanted to work on this project, the problem
      was that the code was bad, but not bad enough that they could redo the
      whole thing; it had been trudging along, for 5 years, collecting patches
      left and right to attempt to fill the leaks. However, it was clearly an
      important, yet, sensitive project.
    </p>
    <p>So what could KPMG's HR team do? They hired more consultants (Me).</p>
    <p>
      (I hope the reader will understand that the context section was written
      with sarcasm and exaggeration in mind. The codebase was quite rocky, but
      the team was solid and we ended up doing a good job).
    </p>

    <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
    <p>
      I was the Front-End expert; for the majority of the project I worked
      alone, and by the end I was training my replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interesting thing about being the sole Front-End expert is that you
      end up acting as a sort of lightning rod for all of the problems with the
      application, as non-technical people can't quite explain why something is
      wrong, only that it is wrong. So we encountered success within the project
      not due to technical skill, but due to clarity and patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous consultants were not very meticulous about their linting or
      the code formatting; so setting up a proper pre-commit hook to ensure
      code-quality was a tremendous boon. Setting up CI/CD was also crucial, as
      before the code was built and pushed through good old ssh ( cowboy
      sys-admin style ).
    </p>
    <p>
      We also got rid of any cleverness, no more fa√ßades or dependency
      injections, we wanted stupid boring code with lots of comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dealing with confusing business rules was the great issue, the solution
      was lots of calls with the relevant stake-holders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounds tremendously obvious; but when the code would say something, the
      manual another and the stake-holder a third thing it was faster to just
      call and hash it out with a small meeting. Remote work tools were a
      tremendous boon in this; we rarely spent more than 15 minutes on a call.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite lucky to have a tremendous team, and a very patient HR
      liaison. Sadly everyone was quite cross with us in the end; as the bonuses
      and raises for that year were terrible.

      KPMG, one of the big four auditing firms, has a problem: They are tasked
      with completing a variety of Risk Assessments on a yearly basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was to standardize the reports; with department heads creating
      the template on a per- client basis and then having the employees on the
      lower-rung of the ladder fill them out. The trickiness came from both the
      access rights to certain parts of the app (and the byzantine business
      rules that guided these access rights). And the required back-and forth in
      between the reports creator and their supervisor.

    <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
    <p>
      Helped the small Front-End team develop the App. Worth noting is just how

      SIGFOX, an IOT company, has a problem: They need to teach their users how
      to use their expensive IOT technology at a minimal cost of entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIGFOX created a small and cheap entry level kit for customers to play
      with beforing plunging into the world of IOT. The focus of the project was
      to create a complete simulation of the SIGFOX backend.
