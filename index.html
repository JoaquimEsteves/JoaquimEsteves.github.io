    It accomplishes this on through a <em>learning track</em> of easy problems,

  Luckily for me, despite the fact that I've only had two employers I've worked

  <h3>ProSieben</h3>
  <h4>Through CBTW: from 12/2022 to 04/2024</h4>
  <p>Context:</p>

  <p>ProSieben's Program Planners have a problem.</p>
  <p>
    The way movie licensing works is: A company buys the rights to play a movie
    or show ùëµ times over a period of ùêò years. As a program planner your job is
    to optimize this, play a movie less than ùëµ times and you've just lost money,
    play it at the wrong time and you've just lost market share! (ie: money)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, program planners are quite good at their jobs, but doing this sort of
    planning on a large scale is tremendously difficult work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution, was to ask the Data Science folks to come up with a model that
    will first predict market shares(or, the fancier sounding: AI Based
    Prediction), and then to build a second model that will attempt to create an
    optimal program (using an even fancier sounding: Constraint Satisfaction
    Solver)
  </p>
  <p>
    The creation of these models necessitated a large amount of data.
    Corralling, cleaning and exporting this data was the job of our
    <em>ETL</em> pipeline.
  </p>

  <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
  <p>
    I was initially hired as Python Developer; mostly to work on the App side of
    the project
  </p>

  <code>
    <pre>
  ETL -> DB -> AI -> App -> UI
                     ^ I worked here
  ^-------------- I worked here too!
    </pre>
  </code>

  <p>
    Once I had proven myself on the <code>App</code> side of the project I was
    able to transition into the <code>ETL</code> side of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was the first time I had the pleasure to work as a Data-Engineer. I'd
    always wanted to dip my feet into the Data Science world but I never had the
    opportunity before.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learned a lot of Pandas, a scientific python library; and I was able to
    leverage my Front-End skills to create what we called "tiny-front-ends".
    Basically small Websites as GUIs to quickly prototype features, while the
    main Front-End team lagged behind.

  <h3>KPMG Luxembourg</h3>
  <h4>Through CBTW : from 05/2022 - 08/2022</h4>
  <hr />
  <p>Context:</p>

  <p>KPMG's HR have a problem.</p>
  <p>
    Every year they need to calculate raises and bonuses for each of the
    employees. Back when the branch was a few hundred employees this was all
    done on a massive excel spreadsheet; but suddenly the Luxembourgish branch
    grew to a gargantuan 2000 employees and clearly some sort of app needed to
    be made.
  </p>
  <p>They then made a grave mistake - they hired consultants.</p>
  <p>
    The consultants delivered a terrible mess. A C# back-end full of business
    rules that contradict each other sprayed to-and-fro. A "classic" jQuery +
    Bootstrap Front-End with yet more business rules that contradict the former
    ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nobody internal to the company wanted to work on this project, the problem
    was that the code was bad, but not bad enough that they could redo the whole
    thing; it had been trudging along, for 5 years, collecting patches left and
    right to attempt to fill the leaks. However, it was clearly an important,
    yet, sensitive project.
  </p>
  <p>So what could KPMG's HR team do? They hired more consultants (Me).</p>
  <p>
    (I hope the reader will understand that the context section was written with
    sarcasm and exaggeration in mind. The codebase was quite rocky, but the team
    was solid and we ended up doing a good job).
  </p>

  <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
  <p>
    I was the Front-End expert; for the majority of the project I worked alone,
    and by the end I was training my replacement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interesting thing about being the sole Front-End expert is that you end
    up acting as a sort of lightning rod for all of the problems with the
    application, as non-technical people can't quite explain why something is
    wrong, only that it is wrong. So we encountered success within the project
    not due to technical skill, but due to clarity and patience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous consultants were not very meticulous about their linting or the
    code formatting; so setting up a proper pre-commit hook to ensure
    code-quality was a tremendous boon. Setting up CI/CD was also crucial, as
    before the code was built and pushed through good old ssh ( cowboy sys-admin
    style ).
  </p>
  <p>
    We also got rid of any cleverness, no more fa√ßades or dependency injections,
    we wanted stupid boring code with lots of comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dealing with confusing business rules was the great issue, the solution was
    lots of calls with the relevant stake-holders.
  </p>
  <p>
    It sounds tremendously obvious; but when the code would say something, the
    manual another and the stake-holder a third thing it was faster to just call
    and hash it out with a small meeting. Remote work tools were a tremendous
    boon in this; we rarely spent more than 15 minutes on a call.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was quite lucky to have a tremendous team, and a very patient HR liaison.
    Sadly everyone was quite cross with us in the end; as the bonuses and raises
    for that year were terrible.

  <p>Context:</p>
  <p>
    KPMG, one of the big four auditing firms, has a problem: They are tasked
    with completing a variety of Risk Assessments on a yearly basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea was to standardize the reports; with department heads creating the
    template on a per- client basis and then having the employees on the
    lower-rung of the ladder fill them out. The trickiness came from both the
    access rights to certain parts of the app (and the byzantine business rules
    that guided these access rights). And the required back-and forth in between
    the reports creator and their supervisor.
  </p>

  <strong>Wut I did:</strong>
  <p>
    Helped the small Front-End team develop the App. Worth noting is just how
    tremendous the team was, a good separation of concerns led to a very fast
    development cycle.
